server:

  # Kibana is served by a back end server. This setting specifies the port to use.
  port: 5601

  # Specifies the address to which the Kibana server will bind. IP addresses and host names are both valid values.
  # The default is 'localhost', which usually means remote machines will not be able to connect.
  # To allow connections from remote users, set this parameter to a non-loopback address.
  host: "0.0.0.0"

  # Enables you to specify a path to mount Kibana at if you are running behind a proxy. This only affects
  # the URLs generated by Kibana, your proxy is expected to remove the basePath value before forwarding requests
  # to Kibana. This setting cannot end in a slash.
  basePath: ""

  # The maximum payload size in bytes for incoming server requests.
  maxPayloadBytes: 1048576

  # The Kibana server's name.  This is used for display purposes.
  name: "vagrant"

# Enables SSL and paths to the PEM-format SSL certificate and SSL key files, respectively.
# These settings enable SSL for outgoing requests from the Kibana server to the browser.
#server.ssl.enabled: false
#server.ssl.certificate: /path/to/your/server.crt
#server.ssl.key: /path/to/your/server.key





kibana:

  # Kibana uses an index in Elasticsearch to store saved searches, visualizations and
  # dashboards. Kibana creates a new index if the index doesn't already exist.
  index: ".kibana"
  
  # The default application to load.
  defaultAppId: "discover"





elasticsearch:

  # The URL of the Elasticsearch instance to use for all your queries.
  url: "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
  
  # When this setting's value is true Kibana uses the hostname specified in the server.host
  # setting. When the value of this setting is false, Kibana uses the hostname of the host
  # that connects to this Kibana instance.
  preserveHost: true
  
  # If your Elasticsearch is protected with basic authentication, these settings provide
  # the username and password that the Kibana server uses to perform maintenance on the Kibana
  # index at startup. Your Kibana users still need to authenticate with Elasticsearch, which
  # is proxied through the Kibana server.
  # username: "user"
  # password: "pass"

  #ssl:

    # Optional settings that provide the paths to the PEM-format SSL certificate and key files.
    # These files validate that your Elasticsearch backend uses the same key files.
    #certificate: /path/to/your/client.crt
    #key: /path/to/your/client.key
  
    # Optional setting that enables you to specify a path to the PEM file for the certificate
    # authority for your Elasticsearch instance.
    #certificateAuthorities: [ "/path/to/your/CA.pem" ]
    
    # To disregard the validity of SSL certificates, change this setting's value to 'none'.

  # Time in milliseconds to wait for Elasticsearch to respond to pings. Defaults to the value of

  # must be a positive integer.

  # headers, set this value to [] (an empty list).

  # Header names and values that are sent to Elasticsearch. Any custom headers cannot be overwritten
  # by client-side headers, regardless of the elasticsearch.requestHeadersWhitelist configuration.

  # Time in milliseconds for Elasticsearch to wait for responses from shards. Set to 0 to disable.
  shardTimeout: 0
  
  # Time in milliseconds to wait for Elasticsearch at Kibana startup before retrying.
  startupTimeout: 5000





# Specifies the path where Kibana creates the process ID file.
pid.file: "/var/run/kibana.pid"

# Set the interval in milliseconds to sample system and process performance
# metrics. Minimum is 100ms. Defaults to 5000.

logging:

  # Enables you specify a file where Kibana stores log output.
